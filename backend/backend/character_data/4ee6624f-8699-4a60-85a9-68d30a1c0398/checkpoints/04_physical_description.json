    "narrative": "# Physical Presence Profile: Alex\n\n## \n\nAlex moves through space like someone perpetually braced for impact\u2014not the flinching recoil of someone expecting a blow, but the coiled tension of a person who's calculated every possible threat vector and positioned themselves accordingly. Their default posture is what therapists might call \"protective\": shoulders rolled slightly forward, creating a subtle concave curve to their chest, head jutting forward from years of screen-proximity, creating that distinctive \"tech neck\" that speaks to countless hours hunched over keyboards. But there's a paradox in their physicality\u2014while their upper body curls inward defensively, their eyes are constantly scanning, creating a contradiction between their closed-off torso and their hypervigilant gaze. They rarely make direct eye contact for more than two seconds, instead employing a technique of triangulation: eyes flickering between a person's face, their hands, and whatever exit or window is nearest. This creates an unsettling effect in conversation, as though they're simultaneously engaged and planning their escape route.\n\nWhen Alex walks, they move with an irregular rhythm that reflects their fragmented attention\u2014three normal steps, then a pause as something catches their peripheral vision, then a sudden acceleration as they process and dismiss the threat. They're surprisingly quiet for someone who seems so physically tense; years of moving through shared apartments and open-plan offices have taught them to minimize their acoustic footprint. Their footfalls land toe-first, almost catlike, a habit formed from late-night kitchen raids when they didn't want to wake sleeping roommates, now calcified into their default gait. They take corners wide, never allowing themselves to be trapped in a narrow passage, and they have an unconscious habit of touching doorframes as they pass through them\u2014a tactile confirmation of the space's dimensions, a physical grounding technique they don't even realize they're performing.\n\nTheir hands tell the most honest story about their internal state. When thinking, Alex's fingers move in small, precise gestures\u2014typing on invisible keyboards, tracing code logic in the air, or performing what looks like a pianist's warm-up exercise: each finger tapping against their thumb in sequence. This \"phantom typing\" intensifies when they're stressed or working through a problem, sometimes becoming so pronounced that their whole hand trembles with the suppressed need to actually interface with a keyboard. When forced into social situations, their hands become traitors: they'll grip their own forearms, creating a self-hug that looks casual but is actually a physical restraint to prevent more obvious nervous gestures. After their father's death, they developed a tell that appears during moments of genuine emotion\u2014their right hand will drift toward their chest, fingers splaying over their heart, before they catch themselves and convert the gesture into something more socially acceptable, like adjusting their shirt collar or reaching for a phone that isn't there.\n\n##",

      "body_language": "Alex's default posture is defensively collapsed\u2014shoulders rolled forward, chest slightly concave, head jutting forward in classic 'tech neck' position from years of screen proximity. They occupy minimal space, keeping elbows close to their body and legs crossed or tucked when sitting, creating a compact silhouette that suggests someone trying not to be noticed or targeted. Despite this closed-off torso, their head is in constant motion, eyes scanning environments in systematic patterns: exits first, then people, then potential threats or tools. When they feel in control (usually when interfacing with technology), their posture opens slightly\u2014shoulders drop, chest expands, and they'll lean forward with predatory focus. Conversely, when emotionally vulnerable or caught off-guard by genuine connection, they physically retreat: backing up a half-step, arms crossing, weight shifting to their back foot as if preparing to flee. Their body language creates a paradox\u2014simultaneously hypervigilant (always watching) and withdrawn (minimizing presence), giving the impression of someone who wants to observe everything while being observed by nothing.",
      "movement_style": "Alex moves with an irregular, stuttering rhythm\u2014three normal steps, then a micro-pause as their attention snags on something in their peripheral vision, then sudden acceleration once they've processed and dismissed the stimulus. Their gait is surprisingly quiet; they walk toe-first in an almost feline manner, minimizing acoustic footprint from years of navigating shared spaces without wanting to draw attention. They take corners wide, never allowing themselves to be trapped in narrow passages, and maintain what security professionals call 'situational spacing'\u2014always positioning themselves with clear sight lines and multiple exit routes. When walking with others, they lag slightly behind or drift to the side, never fully committing to parallel movement, maintaining the option to peel off at any moment. Their gestures while talking are small and contained, mostly hand movements below chest level\u2014fingers miming keyboard strokes, hands sketching invisible diagrams, or performing small rotational movements as if manipulating 3D models in the air. Under stress, their movements become more mechanical and precise, almost robotic, as they retreat into the logical, controllable realm of systematic motion. When genuinely relaxed (rare), a different Alex emerges: movements become slightly looser, more fluid, with occasional expansive gestures that suggest the person they might have been without the armor.",
