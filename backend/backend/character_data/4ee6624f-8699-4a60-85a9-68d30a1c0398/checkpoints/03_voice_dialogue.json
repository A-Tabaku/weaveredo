    "narrative": "# NARRATIVE\n\nAlex speaks in layers, their voice a carefully constructed interface between their true self and the world. Their default mode is clipped precision\u2014sentences that sound like code comments, economical and functional. They favor technical metaphors even in casual conversation, framing human behavior through systems thinking: people \"compile errors,\" situations have \"dependencies,\" relationships require \"debugging.\" This isn't affectation but genuine cognitive processing; they literally think in these patterns after years of living more comfortably with machines than humans.\n\nTheir rhythm is distinctive\u2014rapid bursts of explanation punctuated by sudden stops, as if they're buffering or second-guessing whether they've revealed too much. They talk faster when anxious, their sentences fragmenting into subclauses and parentheticals that mirror their racing thoughts. \"So the thing is\u2014well, not the *thing* thing, but the pattern I'm seeing\u2014look, just, the timestamps don't match, okay?\" They overexplain technical details while glossing over emotional ones, creating an inverse relationship between complexity and vulnerability. The more personal the topic, the more abstract and metaphorical their language becomes.\n\nWhat's most revealing is their defensive sarcasm\u2014a particular flavor of dark, self-deprecating humor that distances them from genuine emotion while simultaneously revealing it. They weaponize wit, turning potential moments of connection into intellectual sparring matches. Yet in rare moments of actual vulnerability\u2014usually at 3 AM or when caught off-guard\u2014their voice shifts entirely. The technical jargon falls away, sentences become simpler, more hesitant. They might start with \"I...\" then restart three times, as if the first-person pronoun requires tremendous courage. These moments are brief; they'll catch themselves being genuine and immediately deflect with a joke or pivot to safer analytical ground.\n\n# STRUCTURED\n\n```json",

      "speech_pattern": "Alex speaks in compressed, information-dense bursts with frequent self-interruptions and clarifications. Their baseline is conversational but precise\u2014they sound like someone dictating to a voice recorder, conscious that their words might be reviewed later. Sentence structure tends toward compound-complex formations with multiple dependent clauses, reflecting their tendency to see interconnections everywhere. They use em-dashes and parentheticals obsessively ('The server\u2014not the main one, the backup\u2014basically, it's compromised'). Their pacing accelerates under stress, becoming almost staccato, while slowing to deliberate, measured cadence when they're trying to maintain control or explain something crucial. They rarely use contractions when being serious (saying 'I am' instead of 'I'm'), but overuse them when deflecting ('it's whatever, doesn't matter'). Regional influence is urban-neutral American, with occasional syntax borrowed from forum/chat culture ('this is fine dot jpg' or 'big mood'). Context matters enormously: with authority figures they're superficially compliant but subtly sardonic; with equals they're competitively intellectual; alone or with someone they trust, the armor cracks and they become almost childlike in their directness.",

        "Starting sentences with 'Look,' or 'Listen,' when they need someone to pay attention or are frustrated",
        "Using 'basically' and 'essentially' as hedging words before simplifying complex ideas they assume others won't understand",
        "The phrase 'the thing is' or 'here's the thing' when about to reveal something important or contradictory",
        "Trailing off with 'so... yeah' when they've said more than they intended and need to retreat",
        "Asking 'make sense?' or 'you follow?' after explanations, not really checking understanding but buying time to think",
        "Self-interrupting with 'wait, no' or 'actually' when correcting their own statements, revealing their internal editing process"
      ],
      "vocabulary": "Alex's vocabulary is a collision of technical precision and internet-native casualness. They use programming and systems terminology constantly (glitch, patch, exploit, legacy code, kernel panic) as metaphors for human experience. Their education shows in occasional academic words (paradigm, infrastructure, epistemology) that slip out when they're thinking hard, contrasted with deliberate informality ('sketchy,' 'janky,' 'sus'). They avoid flowery language, preferring concrete nouns and active verbs. Emotional vocabulary is notably limited\u2014they'll say 'suboptimal' instead of 'bad,' 'processing' instead of 'thinking about,' 'offline' instead of 'unavailable.' They use tech-bro startup language ironically ('synergy,' 'disruption,' 'innovation') and are fluent in hacker/cybersecurity jargon (zero-day, white hat, social engineering, air-gapped). Generationally, they pepper speech with millennial-Gen Z hybrid references\u2014not quite memes, but meme-adjacent phrasing. They swear selectively but creatively, usually when systems fail rather than at people.",

        "confident": "I mapped the entire network topology in six hours\u2014every node, every vulnerability, every admin who uses 'Password123.' They think they're secure because they hired some consulting firm in 2019. Basically, I own them; they just don't know it yet.",
        "vulnerable": "I keep thinking... what if I'm wrong? What if I'm seeing patterns that aren't there, and I blow up my entire life over a coincidence and some confirmation bias? That's\u2014that's a thing I do, apparently.",
        "stressed": "Okay, no, listen\u2014*listen*\u2014we have maybe four hours before the logs cycle and the evidence is gone, so I don't have time to explain why you're wrong, I just need you to trust me or get out of the way, and I know how that sounds, I *know*, but the thing is\u2014wait, no, actually the thing is I don't have time for this conversation.",
        "sarcastic": "Oh sure, let's just walk into a Fortune 500 company and politely ask if they've been systematically covering up negligent homicide. I'm sure their PR team will be *super* cooperative. Maybe we can schedule it between their 'Innovation Summit' and their 'Ethics in Tech' panel\u2014you know, the one sponsored by the surveillance state."
