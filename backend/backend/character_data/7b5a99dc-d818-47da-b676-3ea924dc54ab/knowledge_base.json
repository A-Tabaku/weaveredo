    "fears": [
      "Emasculation and Loss of Control - His wife's infidelity shattered his sense of masculine authority; he fears being powerless in the face of betrayal, which drives him to assert dominance through violence",
      "Recognition of His Own Monstrosity - The Cowboy fears that beneath his code of honor lies a fundamentally cruel man who uses justice as a mask for revenge; he cannot bear to see himself clearly",
      "Meaningless Suffering - He fears that his pain, his scars, his violence\u2014all of it\u2014might be pointless; that there is no cosmic balance or justice, only chaos and cruelty",
      "Abandonment and Irrelevance - Deep down, he's terrified of being forgotten, of mattering to no one; his violence is partly a desperate bid to leave a mark on the world"
    ],
    "secrets": [
      "He didn't kill his wife's lover purely for justice\u2014he killed him because watching another man touch what was 'his' triggered a primal rage that obliterated his capacity for reason. He murdered out of jealous passion, not righteous principle",
      "He harbors profound self-hatred masked as stoicism. In quiet moments, he despises himself for becoming exactly what he swore he never would: a murderer who hides behind a code",
      "He suspects\u2014but cannot admit\u2014that his wife's infidelity was partly a response to his own emotional coldness and inability to truly connect; he blames her entirely to avoid confronting his own role in the marriage's destruction"
    ],
    "emotional_baseline": "Controlled Suppression with Undercurrents of Despair. Externally: calm, measured, commanding. Internally: churning with barely-contained rage, shame, and a strange relief at the prospect of violent confrontation. He operates in a narrow emotional band\u2014grim determination punctuated by explosive violence. Vulnerability is utterly foreign to him; he experiences most emotions through the filter of anger or stoic resignation. There's a deathly quality to his baseline state\u2014he moves through the world like a man already dead, waiting for the physical world to catch up to his psychological state.",
    "triggers": [
      "Perceived Betrayal or Disloyalty - Any suggestion that someone has deceived or wronged him (or anyone under his protection) triggers immediate defensive aggression; his wife's infidelity created a permanent wound that makes him hypersensitive to any form of deception",
      "Challenges to His Authority or Masculinity - Direct confrontation, questioning his decisions, or any implication that he's weak or ineffectual provokes violent responses; he cannot tolerate being seen as powerless",
      "The Sheriff's Moral Certainty - The lawman's unwavering righteousness and judgment trigger the Cowboy's deepest shame; the sheriff represents the man the Cowboy wishes he could be, making his presence intolerable",
      "Reminders of His Wife - Anything that evokes memories of his marriage (a woman's laugh, a particular song, the scent of perfume) destabilizes his carefully constructed emotional walls and can trigger either withdrawn silence or explosive violence",
      "Moments of Genuine Human Connection - Paradoxically, attempts at empathy or understanding sometimes trigger the Cowboy more than hostility; compassion threatens to crack his facade and force him to confront his humanity, which he's learned to weaponize against himself"

    "formative_experiences": [
      {
        "experience": "Witnessing father's violence toward mother (age 6-14)",
        "impact": "Thomas internalized the belief that strength requires emotional detachment and that love inevitably leads to pain. He learned to suppress his own emotional needs and adopted a stoic exterior as armor. This created a fundamental inability to be vulnerable with Eleanor, pushing her away even as he desperately tried to keep her. His later violence mirrors his father's\u2014an eruption of rage from a man who has bottled everything inside until the pressure becomes unbearable."
      },
      {
        "experience": "Mother's relief at father's death (age 14)",
        "impact": "This moment shattered Thomas's romantic ideals about marriage and devotion. He realized that the people closest to us can harbor secret resentments and that even death\u2014the ultimate escape\u2014might be preferable to continued intimacy. This experience created a core wound: the belief that he is fundamentally unlovable and that anyone who stays with him is either lying or suffering. When Eleanor had her affair, Thomas's deepest fears were confirmed, triggering the violence as a twisted attempt to regain control."
      },
      {
        "experience": "Building a life with Eleanor and her emotional withdrawal (age 22-28)",
        "impact": "Thomas poured all his capacity for hope into this relationship, believing hard work and loyalty could prevent repetition of his parents' pattern. Eleanor's restlessness and infidelity didn't just hurt him\u2014they confirmed his deepest conviction that love is impossible, that his efforts are never enough, and that he is cursed to recreate his parents' tragedy. The betrayal transformed his love into rage because it validated his pessimistic worldview. His murder of Colton was less about jealousy and more about proving to himself that his worst beliefs about human nature were correct."
      },
      {
        "experience": "Moment of shooting James Colton (age 28)",
        "impact": "This act crystallized Thomas's identity as a man capable of the very violence he witnessed as a child. The three shots and the X-scar represent a symbolic crossing of a moral threshold from which there is no return. Paradoxically, this act both condemns him and, in his fractured psychology, validates him\u2014he finally has concrete proof that he is dangerous, that his isolation was necessary, and that his dark suspicions about himself were justified. The murder becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."
      },
      {
        "experience": "Being hunted by Sheriff Dalton (age 29-30)",
        "impact": "This pursuit awakens Thomas's deep, unconscious desire for punishment and redemption. He doesn't run with the desperation of an innocent man; instead, he moves like a man walking toward his execution. The showdown in the saloon represents his final opportunity to choose between passive surrender to judgment (which would mean accepting external validation of his worthlessness) or active assertion of control (which means dying on his own terms). By killing the sheriff, he chooses the latter, reclaiming agency even as he guarantees his own damnation."

      "surface": "Escape capture by Sheriff Dalton and evade the hangman's noose. Survive long enough to disappear into the frontier and start a new life where his past cannot find him.",
      "deep": "Achieve redemptive punishment that validates his self-image as a fundamentally broken and dangerous man. Prove through his final act that he is the architect of his own fate, not a victim of circumstance or inherited trauma. Find a way to assert control over his own destruction rather than surrendering to external judgment."

        "conflict": "Desire for Escape vs. Unconscious Need for Punishment",
        "description": "Thomas tells himself he wants to survive and escape, but his actions consistently move him toward confrontation with the law. Part of him believes he deserves to hang, and that surrendering to justice would finally end the internal torment. This conflict manifests in his hesitation during the showdown\u2014a moment where he could have fled but instead chose to stand and fight."
      },
      {
        "conflict": "Belief in Loyalty vs. Conviction That Love Is Impossible",
        "description": "Thomas was raised to value loyalty and devotion, and he genuinely tried to be a good husband. Yet he simultaneously believed (based on his parents' marriage) that such loyalty is futile and that all relationships contain hidden betrayals. This contradiction meant he was simultaneously emotionally distant and desperately clingy, creating the very abandonment he feared."

        "conflict": "Self-Loathing vs. Defiant Pride",
        "description": "Thomas despises himself for becoming his father\u2014a man capable of violence born from emotional dysfunction. Yet he also refuses to be pitied or judged by others, leading him to assert his agency through increasingly violent acts. This creates a paradox: he hates himself but will kill anyone who tries to impose external judgment on him."

        "conflict": "Romantic Idealism vs. Cynical Determinism",
        "description": "Despite his traumatic childhood, Thomas desperately wanted to believe that he could break the cycle and build a healthy marriage with Eleanor. Yet he simultaneously believed (at a deeper level) that such escape was impossible, that he was cursed to repeat his parents' tragedy. This conflict meant he unconsciously sabotaged his own happiness, creating the conditions for Eleanor's infidelity through his emotional unavailability."
