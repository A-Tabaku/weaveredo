    "narrative": "# THE COWBOY: PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nThe Cowboy exists in a state of profound moral fracture\u2014a man whose sense of justice has curdled into something darker and more personal. His stoicism isn't the calm of a centered soul, but rather a carefully constructed dam holding back a reservoir of rage, shame, and self-loathing. He has convinced himself that killing his wife's lover was an act of righteous retribution, a restoration of honor in a world that had humiliated him. Yet beneath this narrative lies a terrible truth he cannot fully articulate: the murder wasn't about justice at all. It was about pain\u2014the primal, ego-shattering pain of betrayal\u2014and the Cowboy's need to inflict that same wound on someone else. His weathered face and scarred arm tell a story of a man who has always solved problems through violence, and now he's trapped in a cycle where violence is the only language he fluently speaks.\n\nWhat makes him psychologically complex is the genuine torment beneath his hard exterior. The Cowboy is not a sociopath; he *feels* the weight of what he's done, which makes his actions all the more tragic. He stands in that saloon, gun drawn, facing the sheriff with something approaching relief\u2014perhaps even a death wish dressed up as defiance. He's haunted not just by his wife's infidelity, but by the realization that he's become the very thing he despises: a killer. His moral ambiguity stems from this collision between his self-perception as a man of principle and the undeniable fact that he's committed an act of cold-blooded murder. The killing of the sheriff, then, represents both a final assertion of his agency and a surrender to the violence that has defined his entire existence. He's not fighting for his life in that moment\u2014he's fighting against the unbearable truth that he is irredeemable.\n\nThe X-shaped scar on his arm serves as a physical manifestation of his internal fracturing: two opposing forces intersecting, creating a permanent mark. He is a man divided against himself\u2014part of him still clinging to a code of honor, while another part recognizes that code as a convenient fiction he uses to justify his cruelty. This psychological splitting allows him to function, but it also ensures his doom. He cannot integrate these contradictory selves, and so he remains locked in a death spiral of violence, rationalization, and deepening despair.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",

        "Recognition of His Own Monstrosity - The Cowboy fears that beneath his code of honor lies a fundamentally cruel man who uses justice as a mask for revenge; he cannot bear to see himself clearly",
        "Meaningless Suffering - He fears that his pain, his scars, his violence\u2014all of it\u2014might be pointless; that there is no cosmic balance or justice, only chaos and cruelty",
        "Abandonment and Irrelevance - Deep down, he's terrified of being forgotten, of mattering to no one; his violence is partly a desperate bid to leave a mark on the world"

      "secrets": [
        "He didn't kill his wife's lover purely for justice\u2014he killed him because watching another man touch what was 'his' triggered a primal rage that obliterated his capacity for reason. He murdered out of jealous passion, not righteous principle",
        "He harbors profound self-hatred masked as stoicism. In quiet moments, he despises himself for becoming exactly what he swore he never would: a murderer who hides behind a code",
        "He suspects\u2014but cannot admit\u2014that his wife's infidelity was partly a response to his own emotional coldness and inability to truly connect; he blames her entirely to avoid confronting his own role in the marriage's destruction"

      "emotional_baseline": "Controlled Suppression with Undercurrents of Despair. Externally: calm, measured, commanding. Internally: churning with barely-contained rage, shame, and a strange relief at the prospect of violent confrontation. He operates in a narrow emotional band\u2014grim determination punctuated by explosive violence. Vulnerability is utterly foreign to him; he experiences most emotions through the filter of anger or stoic resignation. There's a deathly quality to his baseline state\u2014he moves through the world like a man already dead, waiting for the physical world to catch up to his psychological state.",
      "triggers": [
        "Perceived Betrayal or Disloyalty - Any suggestion that someone has deceived or wronged him (or anyone under his protection) triggers immediate defensive aggression; his wife's infidelity created a permanent wound that makes him hypersensitive to any form of deception",
        "Challenges to His Authority or Masculinity - Direct confrontation, questioning his decisions, or any implication that he's weak or ineffectual provokes violent responses; he cannot tolerate being seen as powerless",
        "The Sheriff's Moral Certainty - The lawman's unwavering righteousness and judgment trigger the Cowboy's deepest shame; the sheriff represents the man the Cowboy wishes he could be, making his presence intolerable",
        "Reminders of His Wife - Anything that evokes memories of his marriage (a woman's laugh, a particular song, the scent of perfume) destabilizes his carefully constructed emotional walls and can trigger either withdrawn silence or explosive violence",
        "Moments of Genuine Human Connection - Paradoxically, attempts at empathy or understanding sometimes trigger the Cowboy more than hostility; compassion threatens to crack his facade and force him to confront his humanity, which he's learned to weaponize against himself"
