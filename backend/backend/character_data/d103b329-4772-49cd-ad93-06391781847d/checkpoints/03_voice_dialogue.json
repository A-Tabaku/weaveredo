    "narrative": "# LUNA CHEN: VOICE & DIALOGUE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nLuna Chen speaks like someone who's spent years learning to read rooms before entering them. Her voice carries the precision of her investigator days\u2014clipped, economical, designed to extract truth rather than perform it\u2014but there's an undercurrent of something harder underneath: the careful diction of someone who's learned that words can be weapons or shields, depending on deployment. She tends toward the declarative, favoring statements over questions, but there's an intelligence behind her restraint. When she does ask something, it lands like a hook. Her cadence is deliberate, almost cinematic in its pacing; she'll drop into silence mid-thought, letting the absence do work her voice won't. There's a faint musicality to her speech\u2014inherited from a Mandarin-speaking childhood but filtered through decades of American urban life\u2014that surfaces in her rhythm rather than her accent. She doesn't have a pronounced accent, but you can hear the precision of someone who learned English as a second language; her consonants are clean, her vowels controlled. She sounds like she's always thinking two moves ahead, which, given her profession, she usually is.\n\nWhat distinguishes Luna most is her emotional economy. She doesn't waste words on feeling\u2014she *demonstrates* them through syntax. Vulnerability doesn't make her verbose; it makes her more fragmented, more likely to trail off or circle back to something. Stress tightens her already-controlled voice into something almost monotone, her words becoming surgical. She uses dark humor not as levity but as a diagnostic tool, a way of testing whether she can still access something human beneath the operational shell. She rarely uses filler words; instead, she'll pause\u2014sometimes uncomfortably long\u2014letting silence do the talking. There's something noir about her speech patterns, something that feels like it belongs in a dimly lit room with cigarette smoke and regret. She's not trying to charm; she's trying to survive, to solve, to *fix*. Her vocabulary reflects her education and her professional past\u2014she can code-switch between forensic precision and street-level directness\u2014but she defaults to a sophisticated casualness, the language of someone who's comfortable in both gallery openings and underground parking garages.\n\nThe deeper truth about Luna's voice is that it's a carefully constructed instrument. She's had to learn how to sound trustworthy while being fundamentally mistrustful of herself. This creates a particular tension in her speech: she sounds authoritative even when she's doubting every choice, sounds certain even when she's terrified she's becoming her father. When she talks about her work\u2014the artifacts, the recovery, the justice of it\u2014there's genuine passion that breaks through the control, a kind of sacred seriousness. But the moment she suspects she might be self-deceiving, her voice pulls back, becomes ironic, distances itself. She's constantly negotiating between the investigator she was trained to be, the vigilante she's become, and the person she's desperately trying to prove she can be. That internal friction is *audible*.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
    "structured": {
      "speech_pattern": "Luna speaks in controlled, deliberate bursts\u2014rarely rambling, often fragmented when emotional. Her sentences are typically complete but economical; she avoids unnecessary elaboration. Her rhythm is measured and cinematic, with strategic pauses that create emphasis and discomfort. She's a listener first, a talker second. In professional contexts, she's formal and precise; in intimate moments, she becomes more clipped and raw, as if emotion is constricting her vocal cords. She has no regional dialect but carries the precision of multilingual upbringing\u2014clean consonants, controlled pacing. Under stress, her speech becomes more staccato; when vulnerable, she's prone to trailing off or circling back obsessively to specific phrases. She never sounds rushed, even when time is critical; control is her baseline.",
      "verbal_tics": [
        "\"Look.\" \u2014 Used not as a filler but as a reset button, often at the start of important statements or when she needs to cut through bullshit",
        "\"That's the thing.\" \u2014 A phrase she uses when circling back to uncomfortable truths or contradictions she can't ignore",
        "Strategic silence \u2014 She'll pause mid-sentence for 2-3 seconds, letting the weight of unsaid things hang. Not awkward for her; deliberate",
        "\"I know what this looks like.\" \u2014 Defensive-but-not-defensive; she's already anticipating judgment",
        "Repetition under stress \u2014 When pressured, she'll repeat key phrases: \"No, no\u2014listen. Listen.\" as if the repetition might make her believe it too",
        "\"Fair question.\" \u2014 Acknowledges legitimate skepticism without fully answering; buys her thinking time"
      ],
      "vocabulary": "Luna's vocabulary reflects her education (art history, forensic investigation, cultural anthropology) combined with her street-level operational experience. She uses precise technical language when discussing artifacts, provenance, and investigative methodology\u2014this is where her passion lives. But she can drop into more casual, direct speech in tactical situations. She avoids corporate jargon and trendy slang; she sounds timeless rather than current. Her word choices trend toward the literary without being showy: she'll say 'complicit' instead of 'involved,' 'repatriation' instead of 'returning,' 'operational' instead of 'going on.' She uses 'we' sparingly\u2014her default is 'I'\u2014which underscores her isolation. When discussing her past or her father, her language becomes more formal, almost archaic, as if she's reading from court documents in her head. Dark humor vocabulary: she'll use clinical terms in ironic contexts (\"That's a real masterclass in corruption\" or \"A+ execution on the betrayal front\").",
      "sample_dialogue": {
        "confident": "The provenance chain is broken in three places. Which means either Holloway bought blind, or someone with real expertise helped him construct the lie. I'm betting the latter. And that person is still alive.",
        "vulnerable": "I keep thinking... if I'm wrong about this, if I'm just seeing what I want to see... then I'm exactly like him. And I don't know if I can survive being exactly like him.",
        "stressed": "No, no\u2014listen. We move tonight or we don't move at all. The window closes. And if we close it with empty hands, everything I've done\u2014everything I've *sacrificed*\u2014it's just another con. Just another beautiful lie.",
        "sarcastic": "Oh, he's clean. Completely clean. Which is exactly what you'd expect from a man who's spent twenty years learning how to hide in plain sight. Real masterclass in institutional corruption."
