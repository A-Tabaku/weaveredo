    "narrative": "# LUNA CHEN: PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nLuna Chen exists in a carefully constructed paradox\u2014a woman of meticulous control built atop a foundation of profound loss. Her transformation from art theft investigator to vigilante wasn't a dramatic break, but rather a slow erosion of faith in institutional systems that she once believed could deliver justice. The scar on her cheekbone isn't just a physical mark; it's a daily reminder of the moment her world fractured, of a case gone wrong, of a choice she made that cost someone she cared about dearly. This trauma has calcified into an almost obsessive need for precision and control\u2014if she can orchestrate every detail, anticipate every variable, perhaps she can prevent history from repeating itself. Yet this same need for control is at war with her deepest wound: the knowledge that control is an illusion, that systems fail, that people die regardless of how carefully you plan.\n\nHer dry humor and composed exterior function as sophisticated armor, allowing her to maintain psychological distance from the emotional wreckage beneath. She's learned that vulnerability is a luxury she cannot afford, that opening up to others is a liability in a world where trust has been weaponized against her. Yet paradoxically, once someone penetrates this barrier\u2014once she determines they're worth the risk\u2014she becomes ferociously protective and loyal, almost desperately so. This contradiction reveals her core conflict: she desperately wants connection and redemption but has constructed an identity around the belief that she doesn't deserve either. Her vigilantism isn't purely about justice; it's penance, a way to balance scales that can never truly be balanced, to prove to herself that she's not the person her disgrace suggested she was.\n\nDev, the anxious hacker she's forced to work with, will become both mirror and catalyst for her. His visible vulnerability will trigger her protective instincts while simultaneously terrifying her\u2014because his need for reassurance demands the very emotional availability she's spent years suppressing. The heist itself becomes more than a mission; it becomes a test of whether she can trust again, whether she can be part of something larger than her own penance, whether redemption is actually possible or merely another beautiful lie she tells herself in the dark.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
