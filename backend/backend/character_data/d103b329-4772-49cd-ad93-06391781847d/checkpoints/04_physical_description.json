    "narrative": "# LUNA CHEN: PHYSICAL PRESENCE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nLuna Chen moves through the world like someone perpetually calculating angles\u2014not just of rooms and exits, but of trust, consequence, and redemption. Her body carries the ghost of her father's arrest like a weight she's learned to balance rather than shed. Every movement is economical, deliberate, stripped of unnecessary flourish. There's a coiled quality to her stillness; even when seated, her muscles seem ready to respond to threat or opportunity. Her posture defaults to a slight forward cant, shoulders drawn inward just enough to protect her center without appearing defensive\u2014it's the stance of someone who's learned that vulnerability invites exploitation. Yet within this guardedness lives a fluid grace; she navigates crowded galleries and dark rooftops with the same measured precision, her footfalls barely disturbing the air. The scar across her left cheekbone isn't hidden but acknowledged\u2014she doesn't touch it nervously or turn away from it, suggesting she's made peace with visible reminders of failure, or perhaps still punishing herself with them.\n\nHer hands tell the story her face keeps private. They're constantly in motion when she's thinking\u2014tracing imaginary blueprints on tables, fingers splayed and then contracted as if testing the weight of decisions. She touches surfaces deliberately: running her palm along a wall to feel its age, pressing her fingertips against glass to sense vibration and alarm systems. This isn't fidgeting; it's investigation encoded into muscle memory. When confronted with personal questions or emotional moments, her hands retreat\u2014folding into fists in her jacket pockets, or clasping together at her sternum in a gesture that's almost protective, almost prayerful. Her eyes move constantly, a predatory scan that's become so habitual she likely doesn't notice it anymore. She reads rooms the way others read books, and this vigilance\u2014born from years of tracking thieves and now from navigating her own moral ambiguity\u2014makes her presence simultaneously calming (she notices threats before others) and unsettling (people sense they're being assessed).\n\nLuna's physical energy exists in a state of controlled intensity. She's not restless, but she's never truly still. There's a rhythm to her that suggests someone who's internalized discipline as both shield and weapon\u2014the legacy of her investigator training now repurposed for vigilantism. When she moves with purpose, she's nearly silent, a skill that blurs the line between professional training and something more instinctive, more predatory. But when she's uncertain, this control fractures slightly; her movements become more deliberate, almost mechanical, as if she's consciously overriding her body's impulse to retreat. The contradiction\u2014between the confidence of her physicality and the vulnerability she works so hard to suppress\u2014is what makes her magnetic and dangerous. She's a woman learning to live with paradox written into her bones.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED DATA\n\n```json",
    "structured": {
      "mannerisms": [
        "Scans for exits and security cameras upon entering any space\u2014head tilts subtly, eyes trace perimeters in a figure-eight pattern, often while appearing to look at something else. This happens even in safe environments, an involuntary legacy of her investigator days and her current fugitive existence.",
        "Traces the outline of her scar with her thumbnail when processing difficult information or lies\u2014a self-soothing gesture that's also a self-flagellation, a reminder of a past mistake or her father's downfall. She does this unconsciously, usually during phone calls or when alone.",
        "Runs her fingertips across surfaces she encounters\u2014walls, tables, glass displays\u2014applying different pressures as if reading tactile information. This investigator's habit persists even in casual settings, a way of gathering data and maintaining connection to her environment.",
        "Performs a specific hand gesture when skeptical: index and middle finger pressed together while other fingers relax, hand held at chest level for a fraction of a second. It's almost like a half-formed sign of the cross, suggesting both doubt and a vestigial hope for redemption.",
        "Pauses mid-movement when hearing her father's name or references to his arrest\u2014her body goes completely rigid for 2-3 seconds, breath held, before deliberately resuming motion. The pause is so complete it's almost visible, a brief glitch in her otherwise fluid physicality.",
        "Checks her watch or phone obsessively during conversations about timelines or plans, but not from impatience\u2014from a need to control variables and maintain awareness of temporal constraints. It's a grounding ritual, a way of asserting agency."
      ],
      "body_language": "Luna's default posture is an alert but contained forward cant\u2014shoulders slightly rounded inward, creating a protected center line, but with her spine straight enough to suggest confidence rather than defeat. Her head is typically held level or tilted fractionally forward, eyes engaged in constant environmental assessment. She occupies space efficiently, never sprawling or taking up more room than necessary, which makes her presence feel concentrated rather than diminished. When standing, her weight is distributed evenly across both feet, with a slight bias toward her left leg\u2014giving her the ability to pivot or move quickly in any direction. Her stance is neither aggressive nor submissive; it's the posture of someone prepared for multiple outcomes. When sitting, she maintains an upright position even in casual settings, rarely leaning back fully into furniture. Her legs are typically crossed at the ankle rather than the knee, preserving her ability to stand quickly. In moments of emotional vulnerability or when discussing her father, her posture compresses slightly\u2014shoulders draw in further, her frame becomes smaller, as if she's physically trying to contain something volatile. Her body language is predominantly closed in public spaces (arms often crossed or hands in pockets) but becomes more open in moments of genuine connection, though even then there's a controlled quality to her gestures. She rarely touches her face and avoids self-soothing gestures in front of others, viewing them as signs of weakness. Her presence is inherently cautious but not fearful\u2014the body language of someone who's learned that the world is dangerous but that doesn't require constant panic.",
      "movement_style": "Luna moves with quiet, measured precision\u2014her walk is neither rushed nor leisurely, but calibrated to the environment and her emotional state. Her stride is moderate in length, controlled rather than expansive, and her footfalls are notably quiet due to the way she places her weight: heel-to-ball with deliberate softness, a skill that suggests years of moving through spaces where sound carries consequences. Her movement has a flowing quality, almost liquid in its efficiency, with minimal wasted motion. She doesn't gesture expansively when speaking; instead, her hand movements are economical and purposeful\u2014a slight lift of the fingers to emphasize a point, a precise gesture toward an object, a hand placed on a surface to ground herself. When stressed or processing information, her movements become more mechanical, as if she's consciously overriding her body's impulses. Her physical energy level is best described as 'coiled readiness'\u2014not restless or hyperactive, but perpetually prepared. She moves faster when focused on a task or when threat is present, but even her accelerated pace maintains its quietness. In moments of genuine relaxation (rare), her movements become slightly more fluid and less calculated, though the underlying precision never fully disappears. She has a tendency to move through crowded spaces by reading the flow of others rather than pushing against it\u2014she's an observer first, a mover second. Her gestures when talking are sparse but deliberate: a tilt of her head when processing information, a slight raise of her chin when asserting something she believes in, fingers pressed together when emphasizing a point. She rarely makes large sweeping gestures and avoids drawing attention to herself through physicality, preferring to communicate through presence rather than performance.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "Touches the scar on her left cheekbone with her thumbnail in a specific pattern\u2014three quick taps, then a longer stroke downward\u2014when confronted with personal questions or memories of her father. It's a self-soothing ritual that's also a form of self-punishment, a way of staying present with her guilt.",
        "Holds her breath involuntarily when entering spaces where she's previously encountered danger or moral compromise. She's aware of this habit and sometimes uses it deliberately to center herself, turning a nervous response into a meditative practice.",
        "Cracks her knuckles in a specific sequence (left hand, right hand, then interlaces fingers and pushes outward) before confrontations, negotiations, or heists\u2014not from nervousness, but as a ritualistic preparation, a way of declaring readiness.",
        "Tilts her head approximately 15 degrees to the left when suspicious or when someone is lying to her. It's a subtle tell she's unaware of, a micro-expression that contradicts her otherwise controlled demeanor and occasionally compromises her investigative advantage.",
        "Adjusts the cuff of her leather jacket repeatedly when anxious or when discussing her past\u2014a grounding gesture that connects her to something solid and familiar. The jacket is a link to her former identity as an investigator, and this nervous habit reveals her ongoing internal conflict about who she's becoming."
