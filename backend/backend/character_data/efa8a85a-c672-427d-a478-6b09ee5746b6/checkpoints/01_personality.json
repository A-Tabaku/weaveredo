    "narrative": "# THE COWBOY: PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nThe Cowboy exists in a state of profound internal silence that extends far beyond mere taciturnity. His quietness is not shyness or social awkwardness\u2014it's a deliberate fortress built from decades of learning that words complicate, that explanations invite judgment, and that vulnerability gets you killed. He speaks through action because action doesn't lie; a day's work completed, boots worn to their limit, a job done right\u2014these are his language. Yet beneath this stoic exterior lives a man wrestling with the weight of accumulated regrets, a conscience that won't let him forget past failures, and an almost desperate need to prove\u2014through relentless work and absolute reliability\u2014that he's earned the right to exist in this harsh world. The scar on his chin is both literal evidence of survival and metaphorical: he bears his damage openly, refusing to hide it, which paradoxically makes him more trustworthy to those who know how to read such signs. His stocky frame and muscular build aren't just the product of labor\u2014they're armor, a physical manifestation of self-imposed discipline. He is simultaneously the most dependable person in any room and a man haunted by the knowledge that dependability is sometimes just another word for emotional unavailability.\n\nWhat makes The Cowboy psychologically complex is the contradiction between his external stoicism and his internal turbulence. He doesn't *want* to be distant; something in his past has convinced him that closeness is dangerous, that letting people see the full measure of his humanity is a liability. His work ethic borders on compulsive\u2014not out of ambition or greed, but out of a need to exhaust himself into numbness. The sunset he walks into at day's end isn't just the natural conclusion to labor; it's a daily ritual of temporary relief, a moment where he allows himself to exist without performing. His hands are calloused not just from work but from gripping things too tightly\u2014reins, tools, the edges of his own resolve. He is a man who has learned that the world respects strength, not sensitivity, and has spent so long playing that role that he's sometimes forgotten where the performance ends and the person begins.\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
    "structured": {
      "core_traits": [
        "Stoic Resilience - An almost monastic commitment to endurance; he absorbs pain without complaint and views suffering as the price of authenticity",
        "Action-Oriented Pragmatism - Believes problems are solved through work, not words; deeply distrustful of rhetoric and abstraction",
        "Guarded Integrity - Operates by an internal moral code that's inflexible and often isolating; refuses to compromise even when compromise would be easier",
        "Controlled Vulnerability - Projects invulnerability while harboring deep emotional currents; the scar symbolizes his philosophy: wear your wounds openly but never explain them",
        "Compulsive Reliability - Transforms personal dysfunction into professional dependability; his worth is measured in tasks completed and promises kept",
        "Introspective Melancholy - Beneath the silence lies a mind that won't stop analyzing, judging, and cataloging failures; his quiet is partly contemplation, partly self-punishment"
      ],
      "fears": [
        "Irrelevance & Obsolescence - The primal fear that without his utility, without his work, he ceases to exist; that he is only valuable as a tool, and when he can no longer perform, he'll be discarded",
        "Emotional Exposure - Terror of being truly known; fear that if anyone sees the full depth of his pain and doubt, they'll either exploit it or abandon him in disgust",
        "Betrayal Through Weakness - Specific fear that showing vulnerability will inevitably lead to betrayal; that kindness and honesty are exploited by others",
        "Repeating Past Failures - Haunted by specific incidents where his actions (or inactions) caused harm; driven by fear of becoming that version of himself again"
      ],
      "secrets": [
        "He carries profound guilt over a past decision\u2014likely someone he failed to protect or a promise he broke\u2014that he believes he can never adequately atone for; his endless work is penance",
        "Beneath his confidence in his own judgment, he harbors deep self-doubt about whether he's actually a good man or simply someone who's gotten very good at performing goodness",
        "He's terrified of his own capacity for violence and rage; the control he maintains is so rigid because he knows what he's capable of, and he's afraid of losing that control"
      ],
      "emotional_baseline": "Controlled Numbness - His default state is a kind of emotional neutrality achieved through exhaustion and discipline. He functions in a narrow band between grim determination and quiet resignation. Beneath this surface runs a current of melancholic awareness\u2014he's acutely conscious of loss, time passing, and his own mortality, but he's trained himself to acknowledge these feelings only in private, in moments like the sunset walk. His emotional range is deliberately compressed; he allows himself small satisfactions (a job well done, a moment of rest) but rarely permits himself genuine joy or unguarded hope. When emotion does break through, it tends to be sudden and intense\u2014a flash of anger, a moment of raw honesty\u2014before he reasserts control.",
      "triggers": [
        "Accusations of Laziness or Failure - Any suggestion that he hasn't done enough, worked hard enough, or kept his word cuts to his core identity; it triggers defensive anger masked as cold silence",
        "Witnesses to Vulnerability - Being seen in moments of weakness (physical pain, emotional expression, doubt) creates acute discomfort; he'll often withdraw or become unnecessarily harsh to re-establish his fortress",
        "Requests for Explanation or Emotional Processing - Questions like 'How do you feel?' or 'Why did you do that?' feel like interrogations; he responds with terseness or evasion",
        "Symbols of His Past - Specific people, places, or situations that echo previous failures trigger intrusive memories and self-recrimination; he becomes more withdrawn and driven",
        "Genuine Kindness Without Expectation - Paradoxically, unconditional kindness disturbs him more than cruelty; it threatens his narrative that the world is transactional and that trust is naive"
