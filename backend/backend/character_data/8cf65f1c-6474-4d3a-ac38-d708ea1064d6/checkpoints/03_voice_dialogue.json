    "narrative": "# MAYA CHEN: VOICE & DIALOGUE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nMaya Chen speaks like someone perpetually running diagnostics on the world around her\u2014her voice carries the clipped efficiency of a data analyst married to the street-smart economy of someone who learned early that words are resources not to be wasted. Her default register sits in controlled, measured territory: she speaks in clean declarative statements with minimal flourish, as if each word has been vetted for necessity before leaving her mouth. But this apparent efficiency masks a deeper pattern. When focused on investigation, her speech becomes almost hypnotic\u2014precise, layered with technical terminology that she doesn't bother to translate, assuming her listener will keep up or get left behind. There's no warmth in this mode, only clarity. It's the voice of someone who has learned that emotional accessibility is a liability.\n\nYet beneath this controlled exterior runs a current of barely-suppressed intensity that occasionally ruptures through her composure. Her rhythm accelerates when she's chasing a thread\u2014sentences become shorter, fragments replace full thoughts, and her natural cadence splinters into something staccato and almost manic. She'll catch herself mid-thought, pause with visible effort, then deliberately slow back down. It's a tell. She uses sarcasm not as humor but as a pressure valve, a way to acknowledge the absurdity of her situation without actually feeling it. The sarcasm is sharp enough to draw blood, but it's always aimed inward as much as outward. When vulnerability cracks through\u2014and it does, in moments when her guard falters\u2014her voice becomes almost unrecognizable: softer, hesitant, scattered with qualifiers and half-finished thoughts. These moments terrify her because they expose the exhaustion and doubt she works so hard to contain. She'll often follow them with a joke or a deliberate return to analytical distance, as if she's embarrassed by her own humanity. Her accent carries traces of her background\u2014not thick enough to be immediately identifiable, but present in her vowels and the particular cadence of her speech, a linguistic ghost of wherever she came from before the city swallowed her whole.\n\nWhat makes Maya's voice distinctive isn't what she says but how she says it: with the compressed intensity of someone who has learned that information is survival, that vulnerability is weakness, and that if she can just analyze enough, think hard enough, see clearly enough, she can prevent the next person from disappearing. She speaks like she's always one step away from a breakthrough, and one step away from collapse. Her dialogue partners often feel like they're being interrogated even in casual conversation\u2014not because she's being deliberately hostile, but because for Maya, listening isn't passive reception; it's active threat assessment. She's always mapping, always looking for the pattern that will explain why her sister vanished and why the world keeps taking things from people who love too fiercely.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
