    "narrative": "# Voice Profile: The Climber\n\n## \n\nJake speaks in controlled bursts of energy\u2014rapid-fire sentences that maintain momentum, preventing anyone from asking deeper questions or creating space for silence. His voice carries the practiced confidence of someone who's learned to sound certain even when terrified, with an upward inflection that constantly seeks validation disguised as enthusiasm. He code-switches fluidly but unconsciously: adopting the bro-speak of his climbing crew (\"sick,\" \"gnarly,\" \"let's go\"), slipping into more careful, measured tones around authority figures, and occasionally revealing glimpses of his actual intelligence through precise vocabulary that he immediately undercuts with casual language, as if embarrassed by his own articulation. His speech accelerates when he's anxious, words tumbling over each other in a rush to fill space, to maintain the performance, to keep anyone from looking too closely at what he's actually saying versus what he's actually feeling.\n\nWhen Jake talks about climbing or physical feats, his language becomes visceral and present-tense, even when describing past events\u2014\"So I'm reaching for this hold and my fingers are just screaming but I'm locked in, you know?\" This immediacy reveals where he actually lives: in his body, in the moment of action, never in reflection or future consequence. He peppers his speech with rhetorical questions that don't wait for answers (\"Right?\" \"You feel me?\" \"You know what I'm saying?\"), constantly checking that his audience is still engaged, still validating his existence through their attention. His humor is self-deprecating but in a performative way\u2014he'll mock himself for minor things to control the narrative, preventing others from identifying real vulnerabilities. When genuinely threatened or cornered, his speech pattern fractures: sentences become incomplete, his voice drops, and he falls back on defiant minimalism, as if words themselves are a form of submission he refuses to give.\n\nUnderneath the performance lives a sharper, more thoughtful person than Jake allows himself to be. In rare unguarded moments\u2014usually mid-climb when focused purely on movement\u2014his speech slows, becomes almost meditative, revealing a poetic awareness of his body in space, of risk and beauty intertwined. But these moments terrify him, and he quickly drowns them in a flood of casual bravado, jokes, or plans for the next stunt. His voice is the sound of someone running from himself at full speed, using words as both shield and camouflage, creating enough noise that neither he nor anyone else can hear the questions he's terrified to answer.\n\n##",
