    "narrative": "# Physical Presence Profile: The Climber\n\n## \n\nJake moves through the world like a coiled spring perpetually seeking release\u2014his body a weapon of distraction he's honed against the silence of self-reflection. Every gesture carries the unconscious choreography of someone who's learned that stillness invites questions he can't answer. His athletic frame doesn't just occupy space; it performs space, constantly demonstrating capability even in moments that require none. When he enters a room, his eyes perform a rapid reconnaissance\u2014not for threats, but for audiences, for witnesses who might validate his existence through their attention. His shoulders roll back in an exaggerated posture that reads less as natural confidence and more as a teenager's idea of what confidence should look like, a physical costume he's worn so long he's forgotten it's not his skin.\n\nHis movements oscillate between two modes: explosive action and fidgeting anxiety, with no middle ground for ease or rest. When climbing, his body achieves a rare fluency\u2014muscle memory overriding conscious thought, the only time his physical and mental selves align without friction. But in conversation, in waiting, in any moment that demands he simply *be* rather than *do*, his body rebels. His hands become restless satellites orbiting his torso, seeking occupation in adjusting clothing that doesn't need adjusting, running through hair that's already thoroughly tousled, cracking knuckles that have already been cracked. It's the physical manifestation of a mind fleeing itself, a body trying to outrun the person inhabiting it.\n\nWhat's most telling is how his physicality changes under observation versus solitude\u2014though he's rarely alone long enough for the difference to become stark. With an audience, every movement amplifies: gestures become broader, stance becomes wider, voice projects further. He unconsciously mirrors the physical vocabulary of action movie heroes and extreme sports athletes, constructing a persona from borrowed physicality. But in brief unwitnessed moments\u2014waiting for friends to catch up, standing alone before the climb begins\u2014his body contracts slightly, shoulders curving inward, one hand gripping the opposite bicep as if physically holding himself together. These micro-moments of authentic physical vulnerability vanish the instant another presence enters his awareness, replaced immediately by the performance of fearlessness that has become his default mode of existence.\n\n##",

        "Constantly flexes and releases his hands when not actively using them, as if testing his grip strength or confirming his body is still ready for action\u2014intensifies when anxious or challenged",
        "Performs unnecessary physical demonstrations mid-conversation: one-armed push-ups while talking, hanging from doorframes, balancing on curbs\u2014compulsively proving capability even when irrelevant to the moment",
        "Runs his hand through his hair in a specific backward motion that deliberately musses it further, a grooming habit that paradoxically creates calculated dishevelment, usually accompanied by a quick glance to see if anyone noticed",
        "Bounces on the balls of his feet during any pause in activity, unable to plant his heels fully on the ground, creating a constant subtle motion even when 'standing still'",
        "Adjusts his shirt to ensure his arms are visible, frequently pulling at sleeves or repositioning fabric to frame his musculature\u2014an unconscious curation of his physical presentation",
        "Cracks his neck by tilting his head sharply to each side before any physical challenge or confrontation, a ritualistic preparation that's become a psychological trigger for entering 'performance mode'"
      ],
      "body_language": "Jake's default posture is an aggressive openness\u2014chest forward, shoulders back and down, arms held slightly away from his body to emphasize musculature, legs positioned wider than necessary in a stance that claims more space than his frame requires. His body language is consistently 'open' but in a performative rather than vulnerable way; he faces people directly with unwavering eye contact that can read as either confidence or confrontation depending on context. When sitting, he sprawls with calculated casualness, one arm draped over the back of a chair, legs extended, occupying maximum territory. However, this openness is a defensive posture\u2014a preemptive display meant to discourage questioning rather than invite connection. Under stress or when challenged, his posture doesn't close but rather intensifies: chest puffs further out, jaw sets, hands form loose fists at his sides. The only time his body language truly contracts is in brief unobserved moments\u2014shoulders curving slightly inward, arms crossing to grip his own biceps, head dropping forward\u2014but these vulnerable postures vanish instantly when he senses observation, snapping back to his default display like a switch being flipped.",
      "movement_style": "Jake moves with the restless, explosive energy of someone perpetually on the edge of action, his gait a loose-limbed swagger that emphasizes athletic capability\u2014long strides with a slight bounce, arms swinging freely but with latent tension suggesting immediate readiness to sprint, climb, or fight. His walking pace is consistently faster than necessary, as if he's always approaching something rather than simply traveling. When gesturing during conversation, his movements are expansive and emphatic, hands cutting through air in broad arcs, fingers pointing, arms extending fully\u2014a physical vocabulary borrowed from coaches and action heroes. He's loud in space: footfalls heavy despite athletic build, doors pushed open rather than pulled, objects set down with unnecessary force. His movement rhythm is staccato rather than flowing\u2014bursts of motion punctuated by brief, fidgeting pauses rather than smooth transitions. During climbing or athletic activity, his movement quality transforms entirely: suddenly fluid, economical, and focused, his body achieving a grace and efficiency completely absent from his everyday motion. This discrepancy reveals that his physical capability is genuine, but his everyday movement style is performance rather than natural expression.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "Slaps his own chest or thighs sharply before accepting a challenge or beginning a physical task, a self-administered pump-up ritual that's become compulsive",
        "Cannot maintain seated position for more than three minutes without shifting, standing, or finding an excuse for movement\u2014treats chairs as temporary perches rather than resting places",
        "Touches his own arms frequently, running hands over biceps and forearms as if confirming they're still there, a tactile self-soothing through physical self-verification",
        "When nervous or uncertain, shifts into subtle athletic movements: calf raises, shoulder rolls, quad flexes\u2014using micro-exercises as anxiety management",
        "Mirrors the physical intensity of whoever he's speaking with but amplified: if someone leans forward, he leans further; if they gesture, his gestures become larger\u2014constantly attempting to physically dominate interactions through escalation"
