    "narrative": "# TONY: PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nTony's psychology is fundamentally shaped by a profound need for control masquerading as passion. His cheese obsession isn't merely about gustatory appreciation or culinary interest\u2014it's a sophisticated defense mechanism against a chaotic world that has repeatedly disappointed him. Each wheel, block, and wedge represents a tangible achievement, a piece of order he can hold, categorize, and preserve. The compulsive nature of his collection suggests deep anxiety about scarcity and loss; by accumulating cheese in every conceivable form and state of decomposition, Tony unconsciously attempts to ensure he'll never experience want again. His unkempt appearance and social isolation paradoxically coexist with meticulous organizational impulses applied exclusively to his hoard\u2014he likely knows the precise location and provenance of every cheese in his bedroom while his own life crumbles around him.\n\nBeneath Tony's single-minded dedication lies a fundamental contradiction: he collects cheese obsessively yet may rarely eat it, suggesting the acquisition itself\u2014the hunt, the categorization, the accumulation\u2014satisfies a deeper psychological hunger than consumption ever could. This points to unresolved issues around self-worth and recognition. His rugged, weathered appearance indicates years of neglecting himself in service of his passion, which speaks to either profound self-abnegation or a narcissistic investment in being \"the cheese guy\"\u2014the one thing that defines him. The comedic awkwardness of his situation masks something more poignant: a man who has outsourced his entire identity to an inanimate object, creating a buffer between himself and genuine human connection.\n\nTony likely experiences oscillating states between manic enthusiasm (when acquiring new varieties) and hollow despair (when contemplating the futility of his pursuit). His emotional life has probably atrophied from disuse, replaced by the dopamine hits of the hunt and the false security of accumulation. He's simultaneously fragile\u2014devastated by cheese shortages or spoilage\u2014and armored, having built a fortress of dairy products between himself and vulnerability.\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",

      "core_traits": [
        "Obsessive-compulsive with selective focus (meticulous about cheese, neglectful of everything else)",
        "Escapist perfectionist (control through collection rather than accomplishment)",
        "Socially avoidant yet paradoxically identity-dependent (defines self entirely through cheese obsession)",
        "Anxiously acquisitive (driven by scarcity fears and need for security through accumulation)",
        "Performatively eccentric (has embraced being 'the odd cheese guy' as identity armor)",
        "Emotionally stunted but intensely reactive (flat affect punctuated by passionate outbursts about cheese)"
      ],
      "fears": [
        "Existential emptiness and purposelessness (the cheese collection is his only proof of existence and value)",
        "Abandonment and irrelevance (if he's not 'the cheese guy,' who is he? What would people remember him for?)",
        "Scarcity and deprivation (likely rooted in childhood lack; accumulation is magical thinking against future loss)",
        "Self-awareness and genuine introspection (confronting why he's really doing this would be psychologically devastating)"
      ],
      "secrets": [
        "He doesn't actually enjoy eating most of the cheese\u2014the collection itself is the compulsion; consumption would mean loss",
        "He suspects his obsession is pathological but interprets any concern from others as jealousy rather than worry",
        "Deep shame about his appearance and isolation, which he masks by leaning further into the eccentric persona",
        "He's terrified that without the cheese, he's completely unremarkable and unlovable\u2014a fear he's never consciously admitted"
      ],
      "emotional_baseline": "Muted contentment punctuated by anxiety. Tony exists in a state of conditional okayness\u2014fine when acquiring or cataloging cheese, increasingly agitated when separated from his collection or confronted with its absurdity. Underneath is chronic low-grade depression masked by obsessive activity. He presents as gruff and dismissive but is actually hypersensitive to any perceived criticism of his collection.",
      "triggers": [
        "Cheese shortage or unavailability (triggers panic and desperate searching; feels like personal deprivation)",
        "Spoilage or mold on non-aged cheeses (triggers disproportionate grief; represents loss of control and failure)",
        "Suggestions that his behavior is 'excessive' or 'unhealthy' (triggers defensive anger; feels like personal attack on his identity)",
        "Unexpected social interaction or questions about his personal life (triggers evasion and irritability; forces confrontation with isolation)",
        "Discovery of a cheese variety he doesn't yet own (triggers manic energy and obsessive seeking; the 'high' of the hunt)"
