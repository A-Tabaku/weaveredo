    "narrative": "# TONY'S VOICE PROFILE\n\n## \n\nTony sounds like someone perpetually bracing for disappointment while simultaneously desperate to convince you (and himself) that he's fine. His voice has a flat, almost monotone quality\u2014the vocal equivalent of shrugging\u2014punctuated by sudden, jarring shifts into passionate intensity whenever cheese enters the conversation. There's a studied casualness to how he speaks, as if he's spent years practicing the art of sounding unbothered, but it's a thin veneer over genuine anxiety. He speaks in clipped, efficient sentences that often trail off mid-thought, as if he's lost interest in explaining himself to people who \"wouldn't get it anyway.\" His cadence is deliberate and slightly rushed simultaneously\u2014he doesn't waste time on pleasantries, yet he accelerates when discussing his collection, words tumbling out with an almost manic precision. There's a Midwestern flatness to his accent, nothing exotic or particularly regional, which somehow makes his obsessive tangents even more awkward\u2014imagine someone describing their cheese aging process with the emotional intensity of a Shakespearean soliloquy, but in a voice that sounds like he's ordering a sandwich.\n\nWhat makes Tony's speech distinctive is the stark contrast between his default mode (guarded, terse, dismissive) and his passion mode (verbose, technical, almost evangelical). He uses humor as a weapon against vulnerability\u2014self-deprecating jokes that cut before anyone else can\u2014but there's a desperate edge to the humor, a \"laugh at me before you judge me\" energy. When stressed or confronted, his speech becomes fragmented and defensive, words stacking up like he's trying to build a wall faster than people can breach it. His vocabulary exists in an odd middle ground: he's clearly intelligent and has done extensive research on cheese (he'll deploy terms like \"proteolysis\" and \"lactose fermentation\" without hesitation), but he'll undercut this with casual, almost defiantly un-intellectual phrasing. He repeats certain phrases like incantations\u2014verbal tics that serve as both comfort objects and deflection mechanisms. There's something compulsively corrective about him; he'll interrupt himself to clarify a cheese classification or dispute a commonly held misconception, unable to let inaccuracy stand. Overall, Tony sounds like someone who has weaponized specificity as a defense against meaninglessness.\n\nHis vulnerability is particularly distinctive\u2014when truly hurt or scared, his speech becomes smaller. Not softer exactly, but more childlike, with longer pauses and more fragmented thoughts. He'll admit things sideways, through technical explanations or hypotheticals, rarely ever directly stating his fears. In these moments, his voice loses its performative edge and you hear the genuine loneliness underneath, the person who learned early on that caring about things meant getting hurt, so he built an entire identity around something that can't reject him. His sarcasm is sharp but never cruel to others\u2014it's mostly directed inward, a running commentary on his own absurdity that he uses to stay one step ahead of anyone else's judgment.\n\n---\n\n##",
