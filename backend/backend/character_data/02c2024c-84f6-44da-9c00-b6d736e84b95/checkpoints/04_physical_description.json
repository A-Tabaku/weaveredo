    "narrative": "# TONY'S PHYSICAL PRESENCE PROFILE\n\n## \n\nTony moves through the world like a man perpetually bracing for disappointment, his body a physical archive of decades spent in pursuit of something intangible. His frame\u2014softened by age and indulgence, but still bearing the residual tension of someone who's always slightly coiled\u2014suggests a man caught between surrender and vigilance. His shoulders curve inward as if protecting something precious beneath his ribs, though that protection extends only to his mental fortress of cheese; the rest of him has been allowed to deteriorate with casual indifference. He walks with an uneven gait, favoring his left side slightly\u2014a habit born from years of carrying heavy boxes of inventory, but also metaphorically: the weight of his obsession has literally shaped his skeleton.\n\nWhat's most striking is the contradiction between his deliberate, almost ritualistic movements around anything cheese-related and his shuffling, almost apologetic trajectory through ordinary life. When approaching his collection, his movements become precise, reverential\u2014each step measured, each reach calculated. His hands move with surprising delicacy for their weathered appearance, fingers spread wide as if afraid to damage something irreplaceable. But in social situations or when forced to engage with the non-cheese world, his physicality collapses into something hunched and evasive, as if he's trying to occupy less space, to become invisible to questions he doesn't want to answer. His eyes constantly scan\u2014not paranoid exactly, but acquisitive, always cataloging, always searching for the next treasure or threat to his collection. When he's anxious, his jaw works silently as if he's rehearsing defensive monologues about why his behavior is perfectly reasonable.\n\nThe most telling physical habit is how his hands return obsessively to his pockets, where he keeps scraps of paper\u2014notes about cheeses, prices, locations of rare varieties\u2014which he touches repeatedly like worry beads, grounding himself in the concrete reality of his obsession. His breathing becomes shallow and rapid when challenged about his lifestyle, and his entire body seems to deflate slightly, as if the accusation has punctured something vital. Yet the moment someone shows genuine interest in cheese (or even feigns it), he visibly inflates, his posture straightening, his voice gaining volume and authority, and his hands emerging from pockets to gesture with sudden, animated precision.\n\n---\n\n##",

      "mannerisms": [
        "Repeatedly pats or taps the pocket containing his cheese notes (price lists, variety locations, acquisition targets), a self-soothing gesture that intensifies when anxious or challenged; this is his equivalent to a security blanket",
        "Performs a specific 'inspection ritual' with his hands\u2014thumb and forefinger forming an 'O' as if testing cheese texture/firmness\u2014even when not holding cheese; does this subconsciously when thinking or stressed",
        "Tilts his head sharply to one side when someone suggests his cheese obsession is excessive, a dismissive gesture paired with a tight-lipped smile that doesn't reach his eyes",
        "Scans doorways and exits upon entering any space, cataloging escape routes\u2014a residual anxiety about being trapped or confronted about his lifestyle choices",
        "Performs a subtle 'inventory count' gesture with his fingers, tapping each digit against his thumb in sequence when mentally reviewing or worried about his collection's completeness",
        "Clears his throat with a distinctive, prolonged rasp before speaking about cheese\u2014a verbal cue that signals he's entering 'expert mode' and his tone will shift from defensive to authoritative"
      ],
      "body_language": "Tony's default posture is a protective hunch\u2014shoulders rolled forward, chest slightly concave, as if perpetually guarding something precious beneath his sternum. His torso leans slightly left due to decades of favoring that side. When standing, his weight shifts constantly between feet, never fully settling, suggesting underlying anxiety about stability. His arms typically hang at his sides with elbows bent at roughly 90 degrees, hands hovering near his pockets\u2014a half-open, half-closed position reflecting his emotional ambivalence about the world. His neck juts forward slightly (a posture developed from years of leaning over deli counters and examining cheese), giving him a perpetually quizzical, slightly predatory appearance. In emotional states: When passionate about cheese, his entire frame expands\u2014shoulders roll back, chest rises, and he occupies space with sudden confidence. When defensive or confronted about his lifestyle, his body contracts further, becoming almost fetal in its retreat; his chin tucks, and he seems to physically shrink. When experiencing anxiety (triggered by cheese unavailability or spoilage), his body becomes rigid and trembling, fingers clenching, jaw locked. His face rarely shows genuine relaxation; even at rest, there's a tightness around his eyes and mouth suggesting perpetual low-level vigilance.",
      "movement_style": "Tony's gait is deliberately slow and measured\u2014not from age alone, but from a careful, almost paranoid precision. He walks with his feet slightly splayed outward (a consequence of his left-side favoring) and his head slightly lowered, scanning the ground as if perpetually searching for something lost. His stride is uneven; he unconsciously takes slightly shorter steps on his right side. When moving through his cheese storage areas, his pace becomes almost ceremonial\u2014slow, deliberate, reverent, with each footfall careful and deliberate. His movements are generally quiet; he's learned not to draw attention to himself, and he moves with the practiced silence of someone accustomed to occupying space apologetically. However, when animated about cheese, his movements become jerky and enthusiastic\u2014sudden gestures, rapid turns, increased speed\u2014creating an almost manic energy. His gestures when speaking are typically contained and close to his body, except when discussing cheese, at which point his hands explode outward in sweeping, passionate arcs. He rarely takes large strides or moves fluidly; instead, his physicality is characterized by stops, starts, and recalibrations, as if constantly second-guessing his trajectory.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "Unconsciously traces the outline of rectangular shapes (cheese wheels, blocks) in the air with his index finger when lost in thought or anxious\u2014a phantom-drawing habit born from years of mentally cataloging inventory",
        "Breathes audibly through his nose (a slight wheeze) when concentrating or examining something, which becomes pronounced and rapid when triggered by anxiety about cheese spoilage or unavailability",
        "Cracks his knuckles in a specific sequence (index to pinky, then thumbs) before handling cheese or before defending himself verbally against criticism; a ritualistic preparation for 'performance'",
        "Frequently adjusts the collar or neckline of his shirt with a pinching gesture, even when nothing is amiss\u2014a self-soothing habit rooted in feeling emotionally strangled or trapped in social situations",
        "Blinks rapidly and looks away when making eye contact with someone asking personal questions unrelated to cheese; his eyes dart to nearby surfaces, as if searching for an escape narrative in the physical environment"
